    <p>The AudioWave X100 stands out as a high-quality headphone option with several impressive features. The sound quality is excellent, delivering deep and powerful low sounds (such as drums and bass), clear and natural voices, and crisp high notes (like cymbals and strings). The noise cancellation works effectively, blocking out most background noise in loud environments, making it ideal for travel or work. The ear cushions are soft and provide a comfortable fit, allowing for long listening sessions without discomfort. The charging speed is a major advantage, as the fast USB-C charging allows for quick power-ups when needed. The overall build quality is sturdy and durable, giving the headphones a premium feel that exceeds expectations for the price. The controls are easy to use, making it simple to adjust volume, skip tracks, and answer calls effortlessly. The Bluetooth connection is generally stable, ensuring a smooth wireless experience for most users. Additionally, the headphones provide a decent battery life, lasting for hours before requiring a recharge.</p>
    
    <p>However, there are a few drawbacks to keep in mind. Some users report that the battery life decreases over time, requiring more frequent charging after months of use. The Bluetooth connection may occasionally drop on Windows computers, leading to brief interruptions. The headband material wears down faster than expected, especially if adjusted frequently. The microphone does not perform well in noisy environments, making it less ideal for calls in busy places. Some users with smaller heads find the headphones slightly bulky, and the ear cushions can become warm during long listening sessions. Additionally, these headphones do not support simultaneous connection to multiple devices, which can be inconvenient for users who switch between a phone and a laptop.</p>

    <p class="verified">Verified Purchase</p>
    <p class="how-long-ago">Reviewed 1 week ago</p>
    <p class="content">I really wanted to love these headphones, but the noise cancellation is hit or miss. Sometimes it blocks out everything, and other times I can still hear conversations around me, which makes it frustrating to use in crowded areas. The fit is also a bit too snug, which causes pressure on my ears after an hour or so. The sound quality is generally good, but the bass is overpowering to the point that certain songs sound muffled. On the bright side, they are lightweight, which makes them easy to carry around. Just wish they were more consistent and comfortable for long-term use.</p>

    <p class="content">The battery life was excellent at first, but after a few months, it drains much faster than expected, which makes using them for office calls during long commutes a hassle. Also, the touch controls are not as responsive as I hoped—they sometimes require multiple taps before adjusting the volume. My son, for example, complains of having to press the same button 3-4 times to increase the volume on it when he uses it while recording his drum class performances. That being said, the bass quality is solid, which makes music sound deep and immersive. The overall build feels premium, and despite a few accidental drops, there are no visible scratches. They are also very comfortable, which allows for long listening sessions, but the need for frequent charging is a downside.</p>

    <p class="content">These headphones work fine for calls in quiet environments, but in a café or on a busy street, the microphone does not pick up my voice well, which makes it hard for others to hear me clearly. I have had multiple instances where people told me I sound distant or muffled. Another issue is the connection, which randomly drops, which is incredibly frustrating during important calls. However, the sound quality is excellent for music, which makes them a good option for casual listening. Just do not rely on them too much for voice calls in noisy places.</p>

    <p class="content">Not as durable as I hoped. The ear cushions are already starting to wear out, which is disappointing given how little time I have had them. The plastic frame also feels flimsy, which makes me worried about long-term durability. However, the sound quality is amazing, which makes listening to music incredibly immersive, and the noise cancellation works well, which allows for distraction-free flights. They are very comfortable, which is great for long hours of use, but I just wish they felt sturdier, which would have justified their price better.</p>

    <p class="content">The noise cancellation works well, but it creates a weird pressure in my ears, which becomes uncomfortable after prolonged use. Additionally, the headband is quite stiff, which took some time to get used to. However, the battery life is solid, which ensures that I do not need to charge them constantly, and the sound is clear, which makes listening enjoyable. If you can tolerate a bit of discomfort, they are not a bad choice, but I expected something more ergonomic for long-term use.</p>

    <p class="how-long-ago">Reviewed 1 month ago</p>
    <p class="content">These headphones get warm after a while, which makes them slightly uncomfortable for extended use. Additionally, the buttons are stiff, which forces me to press harder than expected to change tracks or adjust the volume. That being said, the sound quality is fantastic, which makes music feel immersive, and the bass is deep, which enhances the listening experience. The build quality is also solid, which provides durability, but if you plan to wear them for long hours, you might find the warmth and stiff controls a little frustrating.</p>

    <p class="content">The Bluetooth connection can be unpredictable—it usually works fine, but at times, it randomly cuts out, which is frustrating when I am on an important call. Also, the noise cancellation creates a faint hissing sound when there is no background noise, which I find distracting. However, when the connection is stable, switching between devices is seamless, which makes multitasking easy. They are also comfortable enough for long flights, which is a plus. I just wish they were more reliable, which would have made them a much better investment.</p>
